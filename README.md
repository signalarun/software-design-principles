# Object oriented design
+ Single Responsibility
+ Dependency Inversion Principle
  -  “High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend upon details.
      Details should depend upon abstractions.”[Robert C. Martin, et al., Agile Software Development, (Pearson, 2003), 127–31]
+ Open/Closed Principle
  -  “a module should be open for extension but closed for modification.”[Robert C. Martin, The Open-Closed Principle, C++ Report (1996)]
+ Stable Dependencies Principle
  - “software modules depend on the direction of stability. Stability is related to the amount of work required to make a change.”[Robert C. Martin, et al., Agile Software Development, (Pearson, 2003)]. "Stable" roughly means "hard to change", whereas "unstable" means "easy to change". 
+ Stable Abstractions Principle
  - “a component should be as abstract as it is stable.” [Robert Martin, OO Design Quality Metrics, 2 (1994)]
